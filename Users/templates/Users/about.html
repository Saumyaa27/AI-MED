        <p class="lead">AI Med is a ‘Disease Prediction and Patient Management System’ software. </p>

        <p>PATIENT'S VIEW<br>This portal provides an e-consultation facility to the patients. <br>The patients can sign up at the portal. After logging in the patients would observe there are various sections that cater to their needs. A section for predicting the disease that they are likely to suffer from where they can fill a form by providing their details along with the symptoms witnessed. Based on the result of the prediction, the patients can search for the specialised doctors and share the prediction results with the selected doctor. </p>
            DOCTOR'S VIEW<br> The doctor can register on the portal. He/she an view the new appointment requests ,active patient list and completed treatments list.Doctors can send a prescription which can then be viewed by the patient<br>
          The patients and doctors are provided with a chat functionality for any active treatment<br>
          <p><br> <h1>Product Features</h1><br>

          <h4>Registration/Login:</h4> The patients and the doctors need to register on the portal before they can start accessing the functionalities which are available to them. After login, they will be assigned a token to make sure that they are authenticated users.
<br><br>
          <h4>Disease prediction and Doctor suggestion : </h4>Patients fill their symptoms in a form and according to that the system predicts the disease through a machine learning model.
<br>
          The <b>models</b> are trained using various algorithms such as:
          <br><b>Decision Tree algorithm -</b> It is used for classification as well as regression tasks.It is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a test on the various symptoms entered by the user and each leaf node represents the class label i.e. the diseases.
          <br><b>Naive Bayes algorithm - </b>It is a classifier which works on Bayes theorem.The prediction of membership probabilities is made for every class of disease such as the given set of symptoms is associated with a given disease (eg: fungal infection).
<br>The result of each prediction is displayed on the screen. The disease class which is predicted by a majority of the models is the final result.
The patient can search for the concerned doctor within our database or any other doctor based on their location.
<br><br>
          <h4>Appointment Confirmation:</h4> The doctor can set up an appointment with the patient for further consultation and diagnosis if he/she feels the need for the same. This will also replace the manual procedures of recording the appointment dates thereby increasing the reliability , efficiency and performance of the product.
<br><br>
          <h4>Prescription: </h4>Doctors can send a prescription which can then be viewed by the patient. Depending upon the prediction, the doctor can decide whether to keep the further follow ups in an offline mode by fixing the appointment through the portal and asking the patient to follow the prescription till the next check-up or a course of the medicine for a certain period suggested is enough to recover from the disease.
<br><br>

          <h4>Question and Answer(QnA):</h4> The patients and doctors are provided with a chat functionality for any active treatment. This facility helps the patient and doctor to communicate with one another when it comes to fixing appointment dates or telling the precautions that the patient needs to take in case of emergency.
